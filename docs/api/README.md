# API developer notes

This directory contains notes for developing and running the API located at `apps/api`.

Quick start (local):

1. Install dependencies (from repo root):

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix apps/api install
```

2. Set environment variables (see `docs/env.md`).

3. Run migrations (Prisma):

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run prisma migrate deploy
# or during development
npm --prefix apps/api run prisma migrate dev
```

4. Start dev server:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run dev
```

Key conventions:

- JWT tokens must include `userId`, `role`, and `companyId` claims.
- Controllers expect `req.user.companyId` to be present (populated by auth middleware).

OpenAPI:

- `docs/openapi.yaml` is a placeholder for the API OpenAPI spec. Use it with Swagger UI or Redoc.
