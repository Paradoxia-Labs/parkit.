# Project Documentation

This `docs/` folder contains high-level documentation for the Parkit monorepo.

Contents:

- `architecture/` - architecture notes and DB schema.
- `openapi.yaml` - placeholder for the API OpenAPI spec.
- `api/` - API-specific developer notes.
- `env.md` - required environment variables and examples.

How to use:

- Edit the Markdown files here to document features, runbooks, and guides.
- Keep generated documentation (site builds, compiled assets) out of git.

To preview or publish a docs site, you can scaffold a static docs site generator (Docusaurus, MkDocs, or similar) and point it at this folder.
