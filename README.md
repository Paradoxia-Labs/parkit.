# Parkit

parkit. is a **B2B2C parking and valet management platform** designed for companies
that operate parking facilities, valet services, or hybrid parking models.

The platform connects **companies**, **customers**, and **valet staff**
through a unified ecosystem composed of a backend API, a web-based
administration dashboard, and mobile applications.

Its primary goal is to **modernize parking operations**, **reduce operational friction**,
improve the **end-customer experience**, and give companies **full control**
over their parking infrastructure, branding, and users.

---

## Key Concepts

### Companies
Organizations that operate or manage parking facilities and valet services.

Each company acts as an isolated tenant and can define:
- One or more parking locations
- Parking types (open, covered, tower, underground, elevator, etc.)
- Capacity, slot types, and operational rules
- Booking requirements (booking vs. walk-in)
- Company branding (logo, colors, themes)
- Language preferences and UI themes
- Customers and valet staff associated with the company

---

### Customers
End users who receive parking services or benefits through a company.

Customers can:
- Register and manage one or multiple vehicles
- Store vehicle characteristics and dimensions
- Make bookings when required by a parking facility
- Receive tickets and notifications
- Interact with the system mainly through the mobile app

Customers do not manage infrastructure, only their personal usage.

---

### Valets
Operational staff responsible for handling vehicles and executing parking operations.

Valets:
- Are linked to a company
- Can be assigned to parkings dynamically
- Participate in ticket workflows (receive, park, deliver)
- Can report damages and operational events
- Operate mainly through a mobile-focused experience

---

## Project Status

🚧 **Early development**

The project is currently focused on:
- Database design
- Backend foundations
- Core system architecture
- Developer experience and scalability

Features and applications will be incrementally built following
a backend-first approach.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **PostgreSQL** (or Neon account for serverless hosting)
- Git

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paradoxia-Labs/parkit.git
cd parkit
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm --prefix apps/api install
```

3. Configure environment variables (see `docs/env.md`):

```bash
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
# Edit apps/api/.env with your DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET
```

4. Run database migrations:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run prisma migrate deploy
```

5. Start the API in development mode:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Development

### Key directories

- `apps/api/` – Express backend API
- `apps/web/` – Next.js web dashboard
- `apps/mobile/` – React Native mobile app
- `packages/shared/` – Shared types and utilities
- `docs/` – Documentation (architecture, API, env vars, etc.)

### Available commands

**API**:

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run dev          # Start development server (ts-node-dev)
npm run build        # Build TypeScript
npm run start        # Run compiled JavaScript
npm run lint         # Run ESLint with autofix
npm run prisma migrate dev  # Create and apply migrations interactively
npm run prisma studio      # Open Prisma Studio GUI
```

**Root**:

```bash
npm install          # Install all dependencies
npm run build        # Build all packages
npm run lint         # Lint all packages
```

### Code style & Quality

- **TypeScript** – Strict mode enabled
- **ESLint** – Enforces code quality
- **Prettier** – Auto-formats code
- **No `any` types** – Use explicit types or DTO types

---

## Architecture Overview

The system uses a **multi-tenant** design:

- **Companies** – organizations that manage parking facilities
- **Customers** – end users who book or use parking
- **Valets** – staff who handle parking operations

All data is scoped by `companyId` to ensure isolation and multi-tenancy.

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- Required JWT claims: `userId`, `role`, `companyId`
- Populated by `requireAuth` middleware on protected routes

### Database

- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Migrations managed in `apps/api/prisma/migrations/`
- Current schema: `docs/architecture/parkit.sql`

---

## Documentation

All project documentation is in the `docs/` folder:

- `docs/README.md` – Documentation index
- `docs/architecture/` – System architecture and schema
- `docs/api/` – API developer notes and quickstart
- `docs/env.md` – Environment variables reference
- `docs/openapi.yaml` – OpenAPI spec (placeholder)
